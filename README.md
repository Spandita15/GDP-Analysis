# GDP-Analysis
## Data Analysis using Python
<p>Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a measure of the size and health of an economy. It represents the total value of all goods and services produced within a country over a specific period of time, usually a year. GDP is considered a key indicator of a country's economic performance and is used to compare the economic output of different countries.

There are several ways to analyze GDP data. One way is to compare GDP growth over time to get a sense of how an economy is expanding or contracting. Another way is to compare GDP per capita, which is GDP divided by the population of a country, to get a sense of the average standard of living in a country.</p>
<p>If you have data on GDP for a particular country or region and want to calculate the GDP growth rate, you can do so by using the formula:</p>
<p>GDP growth rate = (GDP in current period - GDP in previous period) / GDP in previous period * 100</p>
<p>Plotly is a powerful tool for creating interactive plots and charts in Python. It is particularly useful for data visualization and exploration. I have used plotly to display the GDP of all the countries in our data and also to compare the GDP of countries like India and China.</p>
